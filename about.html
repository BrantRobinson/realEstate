                <div class="flex-column">
                    <p>Larry David is the co-creator of Seinfeld and the star of Curb Your Enthusiasm, which basically means he's made a career out of turning life's smallest annoyances into comedy gold. Never one to shy away from saying what everyone else is thinking (but would never actually say out loud), Larry brings that same unfiltered honesty to real estate. If a house has “character,” he'll call it “weird.” If the neighbors look suspicious, he'll probably point it out before you even get to the driveway.</p>
                    <p>He didn't start this company to get rich, or even because he loves houses — he started it out of spite, after a particularly bad run-in with a realtor who claimed popcorn ceilings were “coming back.” Now, Larry uses his eye for the absurd and his talent for blunt truth-telling to help clients avoid overpriced disasters and awkward living situations. Around here, you don't just get a realtor. You get Larry David — which means you'll get the truth, the whole truth, and probably a long story about why ceiling fans are overrated.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                
                    <p>Our real estate company was founded the way all great ventures begin: out of spite. Larry David once had a miserable experience with a pushy realtor who kept saying things like “This kitchen has great energy” and “You can really feel the feng shui.” Larry, of course, disagreed — loudly — and when the realtor suggested he “wasn't the right fit” for the market, Larry snapped. “You know what? I'll start my own real estate company. Out of spite! And it'll be better than yours.” That day, our doors opened.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning, the company ran on Larry's unique philosophy: brutal honesty and a refusal to sugarcoat. If a house smells like mildew, we'll say it. If the neighbors have too many wind chimes, we'll warn you. And if the asking price is absurd, we'll point it out — loudly, and probably in front of the seller. Other agencies might promise you “dream homes.” We promise you the truth, even if it's uncomfortable, awkward, or involves Larry arguing with a homeowner about why shag carpeting should be illegal.</p>

                    <p>Buying a house with Larry as your realtor is exactly what you'd expect: exhausting, argumentative, and somehow still effective. He insulted the kitchen tile, offended the seller, and got us a discount. Typical Larry — annoying, but it worked.</p>

                    <p>Larry showed me a property and told me, quote, "This is the kind of place you'd ruin with your good taste." I don't even know what that means. Still, I bought it, and I have to admit… the guy knows real estate.</p>
